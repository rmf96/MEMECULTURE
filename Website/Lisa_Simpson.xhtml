            <h2>Lisa Simpson's Presentation</h2>
            <h3>Meme Example</h3>
            <img src="LSP1.jpg" alt="lisasimpson" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" class="left" />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p> The Lisa Simpon Presentation meme orginates from, as you would guess, the animated
                series, 'The Simpsons'. The frame used for this meme comes from season 12, episode
                16, called 'Bye, Bye, Nerdie' and was first aired on March 11th, 2001. In this
                episode, the middle child of the Simpson family, Lisa, discovers that there is
                scientific evidence as to why bullies pick on nerds. She then presents her findings
                to an audience of researches at a scientific conference. On May 16th, 2018, Reddit
                user thomas22howe posted this image to the Subreddit, r/MemeEconomy, a forum where
                Redditors post potential templates for future memes. It quickly gained popularity
                and became a frequently used template on most social media platforms (i.e. Twitter,
                Facebook, Instagram, etc.). The typical set up for the text is a declarative
                statement and an opinion of the creator of the meme. The statements can be
                controversial unpopular opinions, relatable, or humorous breakdowns of familiar
                concepts. </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>This template is a single line format, with all text located at the center of the
                image. As stated above, all of the Lisa Presentation memes we found were declarative
                statements. It was almost always the case that the first syntactic feature was both
                the subject and a noun. The few times where this was not the case it was due to the
                first feature being an adjective attached to the subject/noun that immeadiatley
                followed afterwards. The syntactic structure of the text is conducive to the
                requirements of a sentence.</p>
