            <h2>Success Kid</h2>
            <h3>Meme Example</h3>
            <img src="Baby1.jpg" alt="SuccessKid1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" class="left" />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The Success Kid meme, which is also known as the "I Hate Sandcastles" meme,
                originates from Flickr, a less popular photo source for memes. This photography was
                put up on Flickr by a photographer, Laney Griner, in 2007 who is actually the mother
                of the child in this picture. However, in 2011, the image started circulating as a
                meme with a similar style, yet polar-opposite meaning, to that of the Badluck Brian
                meme, by laying text over an image macro and desecribing a situation that went
                better than expected.</p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>The general trend of this meme was very similar to what we expected to see: null
                subjects, or subject ellipses. While most of the Success Kid memes lacked in
                subjects, they did have very similar content to the Bad Luck Brian memes. The format
                for these memes were <b>top and bottom text</b>. The fragments on both the top and
                bottom of the image macros tend to be verb phrases, varying between past and future
                tense. The subject is, again, not important to the creator in order to communicate
                their ideas, therefore they chose to omit it. However, one can assume the subject to
                be literal (the baby in the image macro), the creator, or even the user themselves.
                It is interesting to see such a significant syntactic feature to be deemed
                unnecessary. </p>
