            <h2>Arthur's Fist</h2>
            <h3>Meme Example</h3>
            <img src="AF25.jpg" alt="arthurfist" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" class="left" />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The Arthur's Fist meme originated from the PBS children's program 'Arthur'. The show
                follows a young anthropomorphic aardvark named Arthur and his every day life at
                school and at home. The image depicted in the meme comes from season 4, episode 1
                aired on September 6th, 1999, 'D.W.'s Library Card/Arthur's Big Hit'. In this
                episode, Arthur becomes enraged when his younger sister breaks his prized toy
                airplane and he punches her. The episode received a rare TV-Y7 rating for its
                portrayal of cartoon violence. In 2016, that episode and that particular scene made
                a resurgence on social media when Twitter user AlmostJT posted the frame of Arthur's
                fist clenched at his side and commented, "This is just a pic of Arthur's fist but
                idk how I feel that it's just so relatable. So many emotions in one fist". Other
                users agreed and began creating memes using the image, often ones describing
                relatable situations that would anger most people. </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>This template is a single line text, located either at the top or bottom of the
                image. While the syntactic structure of the text accompanying this meme varys, we
                discovered that the most frequently found pattern has the text beginning with the
                adverb 'when'. Because of this, the lines of text read more like a fragment than a
                sentence. The second syntactic feature of the fragment is typically both a noun and
                the subject of the text. The noun/subject is usually the word 'you', as the goal of
                this meme is to relate to viewers with a situation they have likely experienced
                themselves.</p>
