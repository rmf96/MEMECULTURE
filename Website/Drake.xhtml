            <h3>Meme Example</h3>
            <img src="Drake3.jpg" alt="dogememe1" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" class="left" />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The Drake Meme, also known as "Hotline Bling Meme" or "Drakeposting Meme", orginated
                in mid-to-late 2015 on 4chan/v/, a video game chat site, after the release of
                Drake's 2015 hit, "Hotline Bling". There were several iconic dance moves and gestures
                displayed in the music video, one of which was made in to a meme. This meme is used
                primarily to convey a feeling of distain or disgust towards something, while giving an
                opposing example of something related that the creator actually likes.</p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>The Drake, or "Hotline Bling", meme is separated in to two fragments: <b>top text</b>
                and <b>bottom text</b>. The top text and correlating picture are typically a noun
                phrase which is something negative that the creator <em>does not</em> like.
                Meanwhile, the bottom text and correlating picture are usually a noun phrase that is
                positive and associated with something that the creator <em>does</em> like. Unlike
                the general trend that we see with our other memes, these memes, for the most part,
                actually <em>only</em> had subjects as noun phrases with no other syntactic features
                to accompany them.</p>
