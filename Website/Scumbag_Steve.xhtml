        <h2>Scumbag Steve</h2>
        <h3>Meme Example</h3>
        <img src="SS23.jpg" alt="scumbagsteve" style="width: 300px; height: 300px" class="left"/>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Scumbag Steve originates from a 2011 album cover from an amateur rap group called Beantown Mafia.
            The image in question is of one of the rap group members, Blake "Weezy B" Boston. The picture
            used in the meme template was taken by Blake's mother. The template gained traction quickly in the
            online community and quickly became one of the most well known memes to this day. The template is setup
            so that content creators can discuss unsophisticated behavior associated with people society
            tends to label as being 'scumbags'. The behavior described in the memes can range anywhere from
            being about a roomate who never washes their dishes to a friend stealing your significant other.
        </p>    
        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p> This template is a top-bottom formatted text. It is designed to be read from top to bottom
        in order for the logical flow of the content to make sense. A significant syntactic feature of this
        template is that, within our corpus, there is no presence of a subject. It is assumed 
        of the viewers that they will infer that the content of the meme is about a hypothetical 'scumbag'.
        The result of this is that the first syntactic feature is a verb.
