            <h2>Bad Luck Brian</h2>
            <h3>Meme Example</h3>
            <img src="Brian25.jpeg" alt="BadLuckBrian25" style="width: 300px; height: 300px"
                class="left" />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The Bad Luck Brian meme was first uploaded on to Reddit in 2012, and was originally a
                picture of a high school boy, who was actually named Kyle. This meme became very
                popular after the first upload with the top text saying "Takes driving test" and
                bottom saying "Gets DUI". As you can see from this example, the Bad Luck Brian meme
                shows a perfectly normal task or action on the top, which usually follows with an
                unlucky result. This allows the reader to find the humor in the unlucky result and
                ultimatel relate to the meme or creator of the meme through mututal
                commiseration.</p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>As we suspected, the Bad Luck Brian meme had a null subject, or subject ellipses, in
                most of the memes that we studied. This means that the creator of many of these
                memes chose to omit the subject in each sentence fragment while still being able to
                communicate what they were trying to say. For the content that <em>was</em> in the
                memes, they were generally two verb phrases: one in the top text and one in the
                bottom text.</p>
