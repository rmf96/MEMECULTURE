        <h1>Such Syntax, Much Meme: A Linguistic Analysis of Memes and Their Structural Syntax </h1>
        <p> The purpose of this wensite is to analyze the syntactic structure of text based memes.
            After creating and collecting our corpus of memes, we will be tagging all relevant
            linguistic and morphosyntactic features in each meme. The end result will be a visual
            representation of what the more frequently used structures are, their degree of
            frequency or infrequency, and where they occur in the meme. This will eventually lead to
            an answer for our research question: what linguistic features do we, as a generation,
            deem necessary and unnecessary in order to properly convey information, and why? </p>
